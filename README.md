## Building a Prediction model for Salary Hike
### Step 1 Importing Data
### Step 2 Performing EDA on data
      a) Checking information of data 
      b) Renaming columns
### Step 3 Data visualization
    - To see distribution of data and to check outliers.
### step 4 Checking co-relation by plotting 'Regression Plot'
### step 5 Validating Assumption of Linearity
### step 6 Data Transformation
    - Purpose of data transformation 
    When many variables does not meet assumptions of linear relationship, normality, independence and homoscedasticity of error terms; when used on linear model or in statistical tests, these may give 
    misleading results. That is why data transformation prior to applying our model is very important in this case.
### step 7 Model Building
    a) Using Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression 
    b.) Square Root transformation on data 
    c.) Cube Root transformation on Data 
    d.) Log transformation on Data
### step 7 Validating Assumptions
### step 8 Model Validation
    a.) Comparing different models with respect to their Root Mean Squared Errors
### step 9 Predicting values from Model with Squar-root Transformation
    - Since it has least 'RMSE' value.
### step 10 Plotting Summary of Squar-root Transformed Model.
